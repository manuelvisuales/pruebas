Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun
[Bridge]
A new day has come
A new day has... come
[Verse 2]
Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy
[Pre-Chorus]
Hush now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
[Bridge]
A new day has come
A new day has... come
(Ooohhhh)
[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun
A new day has come
A new day has.... come
[Verse 3]
Ohhh, a light
Hush now
I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of the boy
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love (a new day)
Hush now
Let the rain come down
[Outro]
Hush now
A new day has come
A new day has... come
(Ooohhhh)
[Chorus]
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun
A new day has come
A new day has.... come
[Verse 3]
Ohhh, a light
Hush now
I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of the boy
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love (a new day)
Hush now
Let the rain come down
[Outro]
Hush now
